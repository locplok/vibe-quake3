# Implementation Plan for Browser-Based Multiplayer 3D FPS

This document provides a step-by-step guide for AI developers to build a base version of a browser-based, multiplayer 3D FPS inspired by *Quake 3 Arena*. Each step is small, specific, and includes a test to validate correct implementation. The focus is on core game mechanics—movement, combat, and multiplayer functionality—using Three.js for rendering, Cannon.js for physics, Socket.IO for networking, and Node.js with Express for the backend. Advanced features like power-ups or multiple weapons are deferred to later iterations.

---

## Step 1: Set up the Three.js scene
- Create a new Three.js scene.
- Add a perspective camera to the scene.
- Set up a WebGL renderer and attach it to the DOM (e.g., a `<div>` element).
- Implement a basic render loop using `requestAnimationFrame` to continuously render the scene.

**Test:** Open the game in a browser; you should see a blank 3D scene rendered on the screen.

---

## Step 2: Add a ground plane to the scene
- Create a large plane geometry (e.g., 100x100 units).
- Apply a basic material (e.g., a solid color like gray).
- Position the plane at y=0 to act as the ground.

**Test:** Reload the game; the ground plane should be visible in the scene.

---

## Step 3: Add a player object to the scene
- Create a simple 3D model for the player (e.g., a capsule or cube).
- Position the player slightly above the ground (e.g., at y=1).
- Attach the camera to the player so it follows the player's position, simulating a first-person view.

**Test:** The player model should be visible, and the camera should show the scene from the player's perspective.

---

## Step 4: Implement basic player movement controls
- Add event listeners for keyboard inputs (W, A, S, D for movement).
- In the render loop, update the player's position based on key presses (e.g., W moves forward).
- Use simple position adjustments for now (e.g., increment x or z coordinates).

**Test:** Press WASD keys; the player should move forward, backward, left, and right in the scene.

---

## Step 5: Integrate Cannon.js for physics
- Set up a Cannon.js physics world with gravity (e.g., downward force of 9.8 units).
- Create a physics body for the player (e.g., a sphere or box shape).
- Create a physics body for the ground (e.g., a static plane).
- Synchronize the Three.js player model with the Cannon.js physics body by updating its position each frame.

**Test:** The player should fall to the ground due to gravity and stop upon contact, unable to pass through it.

---

## Step 6: Refine player movement with physics
- Replace direct position changes with physics-based movement (e.g., apply forces or set velocities for WASD inputs).
- Implement jumping by applying an upward force when the space key is pressed, but only if the player is on the ground.
- Update the physics simulation each frame before rendering.

**Test:** Use WASD to move; the player should respond naturally. Press space to jump; the player should rise and fall back to the ground.

---

## Step 7: Add mouse look for camera rotation
- Add event listeners for mouse movement to rotate the camera horizontally and vertically.
- Lock the mouse cursor to the game window (e.g., using Pointer Lock API).
- Update the player's rotation to match the camera's horizontal rotation.

**Test:** Move the mouse; the camera should rotate, allowing the player to look around in all directions.

---

## Step 8: Implement a simple shooting mechanism
- Add a raycaster that casts a ray from the camera's position in its facing direction.
- When the left mouse button is clicked, perform a raycast to detect hits on objects like the ground.
- Log the hit point coordinates to the console for now.

**Test:** Click the mouse; the console should log the coordinates where the ray intersects the ground or another object.

---

## Step 9: Set up a Node.js server with Express and Socket.IO
- Create a new Node.js project folder.
- Install Express and Socket.IO dependencies.
- Set up an Express server to serve the game client files (e.g., an HTML file with the game).
- Integrate Socket.IO to establish real-time communication between server and clients.

**Test:** Start the server and open the game in a browser; the client should connect to the server (verify with a console log on connection).

---

## Step 10: Handle player connections on the server
- When a client connects, assign it a unique ID and store its data (e.g., position and rotation) on the server.
- Broadcast a message to all other connected clients announcing the new player.
- When a client disconnects, remove its data and notify other clients.

**Test:** Open two browser tabs; both should connect to the server, and the server should log each connection and detect disconnections when a tab closes.

---

## Step 11: Synchronize player positions across clients
- On each client, send the player's current position and rotation to the server every frame.
- On the server, collect this data and broadcast it to all other connected clients.
- On each client, update the positions and rotations of other players based on received data.

**Test:** Move the player in one browser tab; the movement should appear in real-time in another tab.

---

## Step 12: Render other players' models
- When receiving position and rotation data from the server, create or update 3D models for other players in the scene.
- Ensure each model is positioned and rotated according to the server's data.

**Test:** Open two tabs; each should display a model representing the other player, moving and rotating as the other player moves.

---

## Step 13: Implement basic hit detection and damage
- When a player clicks to shoot, send a shot event to the server with the ray's origin and direction.
- On the server, check if the ray intersects any other players' positions (e.g., using a simple distance check or raycast).
- If a hit occurs, reduce the hit player's health and send the updated health to all clients.

**Test:** Shoot at another player in a second tab; their health should decrease (e.g., log it to the console or display it).

---

## Step 14: Implement health system
- Assign each player a health value (e.g., starting at 100).
- When a player is hit, decrease their health by a set amount (e.g., 10).
- Send health updates to all clients for display.

**Test:** Shoot another player; their health should decrease consistently, verifiable via console logs or a basic display.

---

## Step 15: Implement player respawning
- When a player's health reaches zero, reset their health to 100 and move them to a predefined spawn point (e.g., x=0, y=1, z=0).
- Notify all clients of the respawn event to update their views of the player's new position.

**Test:** Reduce a player's health to zero (e.g., by shooting); they should reappear at the spawn point with full health.

---

## Step 16: Add essential UI elements
- Add a health bar to the screen that reflects the player's current health.
- Place a crosshair graphic in the center of the screen.

**Test:** Take damage; the health bar should decrease. The crosshair should remain visible and centered at all times.

---

## Step 17: Create a simple map using Three.js
- Create a few simple objects like platforms or walls using Three.js geometries (e.g., boxes).
- Add corresponding Cannon.js physics bodies to these objects for collision detection.

**Test:** Move the player around; they should collide with the map objects and not pass through them.

---

## Step 18: Optimize player movement and input handling
- Adjust movement calculations to use delta time (time between frames) for consistent speed across different frame rates.
- Ensure movement direction aligns with the camera's facing direction (e.g., W moves where the player is looking).

**Test:** Move and look around; movement should feel smooth and consistent, with direction matching the camera's orientation.
