# Quake 3 Arena Game Design Document

## 1. Overview
This document outlines the design for a 3D first-person shooter (FPS) game that replicates the core mechanics, gameplay, and aesthetic of *Quake 3 Arena*. The game will be a fast-paced, multiplayer-focused FPS with fully functional 3D environments, weapons, and movement mechanics. It will be developed using modern web technologies (Three.js for 3D rendering, JavaScript for logic, and WebGL for performance) to ensure accessibility and usability in browsers.

### 1.1 Game Concept
- **Genre**: First-Person Shooter (Multiplayer)
- **Platform**: Web-based ( playable in modern browsers)
- **Target Audience**: FPS enthusiasts, fans of classic arena shooters, ages 16+
- **Core Gameplay**: Fast-paced, skill-based combat in 3D arenas with a focus on movement, aim, and map control.
- **Perspective**: First-person
- **Art Style**: Low-poly, retro-inspired aesthetic with vibrant textures, reminiscent of *Quake 3 Arena*.
- **Multiplayer**: Supports up to 16 players per match, with dedicated servers or peer-to-peer networking.

## 2. Core Mechanics

### 2.1 Player Movement
- **Strafe Jumping**: Players can gain speed by combining jumps with strafing, a hallmark of *Quake 3*’s movement system.
  - Acceleration increases with precise mouse and keyboard inputs.
  - Bunny hopping allows continuous speed retention.
- **Double Jump**: Limited to specific power-ups or maps.
- **Crouch Sliding**: Players can crouch mid-movement for quick slides under obstacles.
- **Wall Running**: Available on designated surfaces for advanced navigation.
- **Physics**: Gravity set to 9.8 m/s², with adjustable values for map-specific effects (e.g., low-gravity zones).

### 2.2 Combat
- **Weapons**: Replicate *Quake 3*’s iconic arsenal:
  - **Gauntlet**: Melee weapon, high damage, short range.
  - **Machine Gun**: Rapid-fire, low damage, high accuracy.
  - **Shotgun**: Close-range, spread damage.
  - **Grenade Launcher**: Arcing projectiles, splash damage.
  - **Rocket Launcher**: High damage, splash damage, slow fire rate.
  - **Lightning Gun**: Continuous beam, medium damage, short range.
  - **Railgun**: Hitscan, high damage, long reload time.
  - **Plasma Rifle**: Rapid-fire projectiles, moderate damage.
  - **BFG**: Rare, devastating projectile with massive splash damage.
- **Weapon Switching**: Instantaneous, with animations for visual feedback.
- **Ammo System**: Each weapon has limited ammo, replenished via pickups.
- **Damage Feedback**: Visual (blood splashes, hit markers) and audio (grunts, impact sounds) cues.

### 2.3 Health and Armor
- **Health**: Default 100 HP, max 200 with power-ups.
- **Armor**: Absorbs 66% of incoming damage, max 200.
- **Regeneration**: No automatic regen; health and armor restored via pickups.
- **Pickups**:
  - Small Health (+25 HP), Large Health (+50 HP).
  - Yellow Armor (+50 armor), Red Armor (+100 armor).
  - Mega Health (+100 HP, stacks to 200), Mega Armor (+100 armor, stacks to 200).

### 2.4 Power-Ups
- **Quad Damage**: Multiplies damage by 4x for 30 seconds.
- **Haste**: Increases movement and fire rate by 1.5x for 30 seconds.
- **Invisibility**: Partial transparency for 30 seconds.
- **Regeneration**: Restores 5 HP/second for 30 seconds.
- **Respawn Timers**: Power-ups respawn every 2 minutes.

## 3. Game Modes
- **Deathmatch**: Free-for-all, first to 25 frags wins (10-minute limit).
- **Team Deathmatch**: Two teams, first to 50 frags or highest score in 10 minutes.
- **Capture the Flag**: Steal the enemy flag and return it to your base (15-minute limit).
- **Tournament**: 1v1 duels, first to 15 frags (8-minute limit).
- **Clan Arena**: Team-based, no respawns, last team standing wins.

## 4. Level Design
- **Map Philosophy**: Symmetrical or balanced asymmetrical layouts to encourage flow and map control.
- **Key Elements**:
  - Verticality: Multiple levels with ramps, platforms, and jump pads.
  - Choke Points: Narrow areas for intense fights.
  - Open Arenas: Large spaces for long-range combat.
  - Teleporters: Instant travel between map sections.
  - Hazard Zones: Lava, acid, or void areas for risk/reward.
- **Sample Maps**:
  - **Q3DM6 (The Camping Grounds)**: Open map with central atrium, jump pads, and sniper perches.
  - **Q3TOURNEY2 (The Proving Grounds)**: Tight 1v1 map with verticality and teleporters.
  - **Q3CTF4 (Stronghold)**: CTF map with mirrored bases and hazardous midsection.
- **Assets**: Modular 3D models (crates, pillars, platforms) with *Quake 3*-style gothic/industrial textures.

### 11.2 Sample Code Snippet (Movement)

class Player {
  constructor() {
    this.position = new THREE.Vector3(0, 0, 0);
    this.velocity = new THREE.Vector3(0, 0, 0);
    this.speed = 5;
    this.jumpForce = 10;
    this.isGrounded = false;
  }

  update(delta) {
    // Apply gravity
    if (!this.isGrounded) {
      this.velocity.y -= 9.8 * delta;
    }

    // Strafe movement
    if (keys.w) this.velocity.z -= this.speed * delta;
    if (keys.s) this.velocity.z += this.speed * delta;
    if (keys.a) this.velocity.x -= this.speed * delta;
    if (keys.d) this.velocity.x += this.speed * delta;

    // Jump
    if (keys.space && this.isGrounded) {
      this.velocity.y = this.jumpForce;
      this.isGrounded = false;
    }

    // Apply velocity
    this.position.add(this.velocity.clone().multiplyScalar(delta));

    // Ground check (simplified)
    if (this.position.y <= 0) {
      this.position.y = 0;
      this.velocity.y = 0;
      this.isGrounded = true;
    }
  }
}


### 11.3 Sample Map Layout (Q3DM6-inspired)
- **Central Atrium**: Open area with Mega Health and Rocket Launcher.
- **Upper Walkways**: Railgun spawn, connected by jump pads.
- **Lower Tunnels**: Shotgun and armor pickups, tight corridors.
- **Teleporters**: Link upper and lower levels for quick navigation.

This document provides a comprehensive blueprint for recreating *Quake 3 Arena* as a fully functional, browser-based 3D FPS. Adjustments can be made based on development constraints or community feedback.
